# NUR
#### A runner game

The goal of this game is to 'NUR' (run backwards) not to be caught by the bear.

Be careful because trees on your way back might block you.

## Install

First, set `bear.png` and `tree.png` and `ground.jpg` into `assets/` directory.

```shell
pip3 install -U pip
pip3 install kivy
```

## Play

Then, you can launch:

```shell
python3 main.py
```
